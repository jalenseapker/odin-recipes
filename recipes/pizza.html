    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
       This dish is known as "Pizza" or more specifically a pepperoni pizza. There are many ways this food can be made but most simply it is made by first making your pizza dough and stretching it out into the size of the finished pizza. Adding a tomato based sauce for the first layer (usually marinara), then shredded mozzarella cheese, and finally sliced pepperoni. You then bake this in the oven on a pizza stone until the crust is golden brown.
