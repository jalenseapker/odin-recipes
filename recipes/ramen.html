    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup dish featuring Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a flavorful broth. The broth can be made from various ingredients, such as pork, chicken, or miso, often simmered for hours to develop rich flavors. Common toppings include sliced pork (chashu), green onions, nori (seaweed), and soft-boiled eggs.

        To make ramen, you typically start by preparing the broth, cooking the noodles separately until they're just tender, and then assembling the dish by adding the noodles to the broth and topping it with your choice of garnishes. Each region in Japan has its own variations, making ramen a versatile and beloved comfort food!
