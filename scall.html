    <h1>Scallion Pancake</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Scallion pancakes, or "cong you bing," are a popular Chinese savory snack made from dough layered with finely chopped scallions. The dough typically consists of flour and water, which is kneaded and rolled out. After spreading a thin layer of oil and sprinkling the scallions on top, the dough is rolled into a log and then coiled into a spiral. This is flattened again and pan-fried until golden and crispy on the outside, while remaining tender inside. The result is a flaky, savory pancake thatâ€™s perfect for dipping in soy sauce or other sauces.
